# CatacombWebGL

CatacombWebGL is a project that [I](https://jayschwa.net) worked on at the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com) in 2017. [Catacomb 3-D](catacomb.games) is a first-person shooter from the early 1990s that I used to play as a kid. I thought it would be fun to attempt to recreate it using WebGL.

## Setup
